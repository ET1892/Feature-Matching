### Feature Matching & Stereo Vision

This project implements a stereo vision pipeline for feature detection, matching, and depth estimation. Using OpenCV and Python, the project explores how visual features can be detected and matched across stereo image pairs to reconstruct 3D information.

**Key Features:**
- *Implemented Sift*
- Conducted statistical summaries and visualisation to identify distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Created geographic heatmaps showing above and below average priced properties.
- Fitted polynomial curves to reveal trends and relationships between variables.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Language:** Julia
- **Interactive Notebook:** Pluto Notebooks for live code execution and visualisation.
- **Data Visualisation Libraries:** Plots.jl, StatsPlots.jl for creating charts, heatmaps, and trend lines.

**Project Highlights:**
- Subsetted and transformed data to focus on key variables for plotting.
- Geographic heatmaps illustrate that higher priced properties cluster near the city center, while lower priced houses spread to outer suburbs.
- Polynomial curve fitting provides a clear trend of pricing patterns relative to variables like distance and room count.
- Interactive and reproducible workflow via Pluto notebooks.

This project serves as an introduction to real world EDA using Julia and highlights the importance of visualising data analysis.
